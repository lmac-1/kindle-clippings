The Chinese harvest in 1960 was smaller than planned because of a bad season combined with poor governmental advice about how to grow crops more effectively. The local governments didn’t want to show bad results, so they took all the food and sent it to the central government. There was no food left. One year later the shocked inspectors were delivering eyewitness reports of cannibalism and dead bodies along roads. The government denied that its central planning had failed, and the catastrophe was kept secret by the Chinese government for 36 years.

Employees earn and get taxed, and they try to live on what is left. A corporation earns, spends everything it can, and is taxed on anything that is left. It’s one of the biggest legal tax loopholes that the rich use. They’re easy to set up and are not expensive if you own investments that are producing good cashflow. For example, by owning your own corporation, your vacations can be board meetings in Hawaii. Car payments, insurance, repairs, and health-club memberships are company expenses.

        'I believe that life is like a river, and that most people jump on the river of life without ever really deciding where they want to end up. So, in a short period of time, they get caught up in the current: current events, current fears, current challenges. When they come to forks in the river, they don’t consciously decide where they want to go, or which is the right direction for them. They merely “go with the flow.” They become a part of the mass of people who are directed by the environment instead of by their own values. As a result, they feel out of control. They remain in this unconscious state until one day the sound of the raging water awakens them, and they discover that they’re five feet from Niagara Falls in a boat with no oars. At this point, they say, “Oh, shoot!” But by then it’s too late. They’re going to take a fall. Sometimes it’s an emotional fall. Sometimes it’s a physical fall. Sometimes it’s a financial fall. It’s likely that whatever challenges you have in your life currently could have been avoided by some better decisions upstream.',

And within a year, I’d have a decade’s worth of growth. My associates talked about how “lucky” I was to have been born with such an “innate” talent. I tried to tell them what I’m telling you now: mastery takes as long as you want it to take. By the way, were all of my speeches great? Far from it!

First of all, there is a clear relationship in rice farming between effort and reward. The harder you work a rice field, the more it yields. Second, it’s complex work. The rice farmer isn’t simply planting in the spring and harvesting in the fall. He or she effectively runs a small business, juggling a family workforce, hedging uncertainty through seed selection, building and managing a sophisticated irrigation system, and coordinating the complicated process of harvesting the first crop while simultaneously preparing the second crop.',

White supremacy does not refer to individual white people per se and their individual intentions, but to a political-economic social system of domination. This system is based on the historical and current accumulation of structural power that privileges, centralizes, and elevates white people as a group . . . .

If [humans] think long term, we can accomplish things that we wouldn’t otherwise accomplish,” Bezos said. “Time horizons matter, they matter a lot. The other thing I would point out is that we humans are getting awfully sophisticated in technological ways and have a lot of potential to be very dangerous to ourselves.

Japanese women on average were doing something special to live almost 8 percent longer than American women. Their moai may very well be part of the equation. Chronic stress takes its toll on overall health, and these women have a culturally ingrained mechanism that sheds it every afternoon at 3:30 p.m. Books like Bowling Alone chronicle how people in the United States are increasingly alienated from their neighbors. On average, an American has only two close friends he or she can count on, recently down from three, which may contribute to an increasing sense of stress.',

One huge advantage of a vegetarian diet is how much it is associated with lower body weight. In fact we just cracked some numbers from AHS-2 that show that Adventists who are what we call lacto-ovo vegetarians, meaning they eat eggs and other dairy products, still are an average of 16 pounds lighter than Adventists of the same height who are nonvegetarian. And Adventists who are strictly vegan, which is only 4 percent, are 30 to 32 pounds lighter than nonvegetarian Adventists of the same height.

        "THE MAJOR ATTRIBUTES OF LEADERSHIP The following are important factors of leadership:-- 1      UNWAVERING COURAGE based upon knowledge of self, and of one's occupation. No follower wishes to be dominated by a leader who lacks self-confidence and courage. No intelligent follower will be dominated by such a leader very long. 2      SELF-CONTROL. The man who cannot control himself, can never control others. Self-control sets a mighty example for one's followers, which the more intelligent will emulate. 3      A KEEN SENSE OF JUSTICE. Without a sense of fairness and justice, no leader can command and retain the respect of his followers. 4      DEFINITENESS OF DECISION. The man who wavers in his decisions, shows that he is not sure of himself. He cannot lead others successfully. 5      DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. The successful leader must plan his work, and work his plan. A leader who moves by guesswork, without practical, definite plans, is comparable to a ship without a rudder. Sooner or later he will land on the rocks. 6      THE HABIT OF DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR. One of the penalties of leadership is the necessity of willingness, upon the part of the leader, to do more than he requires of his followers. 7      A PLEASING PERSONALITY. No slovenly, careless person can become a successful leader. Leadership calls for respect. Followers will not respect a leader who does not grade high on all of the factors of a Pleasing Personality. 8      SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING. The successful leader must be in sympathy with his followers. Moreover, he must understand them and their problems. 9      MASTERY OF DETAIL. Successful leadership calls for mastery of details of the leader's position. 10      WILLINGNESS TO ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY. The successful leader must be willing to assume responsibility for the mistakes and the shortcomings of his followers. If he tries to shift this responsibility, he will not remain the leader. If one of his followers makes a mistake, and shows himself incompetent, the leader must consider that it is he who failed. 11      COOPERATION. The successful leader must understand, and apply the principle of cooperative effort and be able to induce his followers to do the same. Leadership calls for POWER, and power calls for COOPERATION.",

It is comparatively easy to acquire and to maintain persistence in pursuing the object of intense desire. [c]      SELF-RELIANCE. Belief in one\'s ability to carry out a plan encourages one to follow the plan through with persistence. (Self-reliance can be developed through the principle described in the chapter on auto-suggestion). [d]      DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. Organized plans, even though they may be weak and entirely impractical, encourage persistence. [e]      ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE. Knowing that one\'s plans are sound, based upon experience or observation, encourages persistence; "guessing" instead of "knowing" destroys persistence. [f]              CO-OPERATION. Sympathy, understanding, and harmonious cooperation with others tend to develop persistence. [g]      WILL-POWER. The habit of concentrating one\'s thoughts upon the building of plans for the attainment of a definite purpose, leads to persistence. [h]      HABIT. Persistence is the direct result of habit. The mind absorbs and becomes a part of the daily experiences upon which it feeds. Fear, the worst of all enemies, can be effectively cured by forced repetition of acts of courage.

We have bits of exterior siding in our attic, old sections of roof that are now beneath the existing roof, a light-switch-sized hole in the middle of the house that blows freezing cold air from some unknown pathway all winter long, and bricks with rounded corners on the front side of our house but bricks with sharp corners on the back.

        'Consider participating in what I think is one of the most liberating experiments ever conducted—the Barry Manilow experiment.14 Here, researchers recruited unknowing undergraduates to participate in what they believed was a standard psychology experiment. Imagine you are one of them. When you arrive at the lab, the experimenter leads you down the hallway into a small room, shuts the door behind you, and asks you to “put on this T-shirt as part of the experiment.” You unfurl it before you and there, in all of its glory, is a shirt emblazoned with a large picture of Barry Manilow. You might be a big fan, but most people are not. Even fans might be a bit reluctant to bare their enthusiasm in a full-frontal exposure. But you go along anyway, put on the T-shirt, and follow the experimenter back down the hallway; she leads you into a room where other participants are already sitting (none, of course, wearing a Manilow shirt). The experimenter explains that you’re running a bit late but you can still participate anyway. So you slink into your chair, at which point the experimenter appears to have a change of heart, apologizes, and says that it’s really too late and that you’ll need to do this experiment another time. She then leads you out of the room. Here comes the most important part. The experimenter tells you that the experiment is actually now over and asks you to estimate the number of people in the room who would be able to identify the person on your shirt. While you are outside the room, the experimenter asks the other people sitting in the room to identify who was on your shirt. Those wearing the shirt estimated that nearly 50 percent would notice their Manilow shirt when, in fact, only 23 percent actually did.

The Swedish measurement system had twelve inches to a foot whereas the Dutch system had only eleven. These crews, working with their own rulers from the very same blueprints had built a warship with considerably more wood on one side than on the other, causing it to roll over as soon as the wind caught its sails on the lighter side.

If the enemy is like an unfeeling animal, then a truly terrifying display of strength is needed for them to be sufficiently afraid. But if the enemy fights out of empathy for their own group members and a cause that is greater than any one of them, then “shock and awe” may inspire them as much as it terrifies them. That seemed to be precisely what happened after the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. “The concept of ‘shock and awe,’ ” said retired Pakistani general Talat Masood, “could drive moderate and uncommitted civilians toward anti-Americanism.” One of the most popular songs in Pakistan in 2007, in a region being hit by ten drone strikes per week, included the lines “America’s heartless terrorism,/Killing people like insects,/But honor does not fear power.”28 Shock and awe seems like a poor strategy for fighting warriors who love their cause as much as we love ours.',

        'The problem is that life is viewed routinely through the zoom lens, narrowly focused on persons rather than on the broader contexts that influence a person’s actions. When an Olympic gold medalist sprints across the finish line, we see the triumph of an individual’s talent, skill, desire, and will to win. Invisible are the thousands of hours spent in practice, the time and money shelled out by parents and sponsors for support, the luck of finding just the right coach at just the right time, and the tremendous fortune that comes from living in a peaceful country where a person can devote a life to sports rather than survival. The recipe for winning a gold medal involves many ingredients that are completely hidden from view while you’re watching the final race.',

        'Shortly after beating a cancer diagnosis and winning his first Tour de France, in 1999, for instance, Lance Armstrong held a press conference in which he was asked a question that allowed him to reveal his broader perspective.13 Speaking straight from common sense and a limited perspective, a reporter asked Armstrong whether his Tour victory proved that with enough will and determination you could overcome anything. Certainly a narrow focus on Armstrong’s success suggested as much, but Armstrong knew the broader context of his recovery, which had nothing to do with his mind. His response? “No,” he reportedly said, describing how, while undergoing chemotherapy, he had seen plenty of people who’d wanted to live even more than he did, who’d fought just as hard, but who had still died. Beating cancer, he said, was about much more than grit. It was about science, money, and luck.',

        'Convincing people not to litter is hard, and most already know that they’re not supposed to simply toss their garbage on the ground. The bigger problem is that human beings are social animals and tend to do what others around them are doing. If you want to keep people from littering in your county park, a good start would be to add additional trash cans to make it easier to do the right thing, and then to pick up existing trash that otherwise makes it look like everyone else is littering. Human beings, like any animal, are more likely to do things that are easy rather than hard. They don’t have some deep desire to litter; they’re just more likely to do whatever is going on around them.',

They do not know the darkness and the heartaches; they only see the light and joy, and call it "luck". They do not see the long and arduous journey, but only behold the pleasant goal, and call it "good fortune," do not understand the process, but only perceive the result, and call it chance.',

People can spot if you’re trying too hard to be ‘real’ too, just be as close to your IRL self as possible. • Arrange small events or meet-ups (in collaboration with like-minded people if you don’t want to do it alone). Ask people to bring a friend to widen the net. • Offer proper value – whether that’s opportunities, information, giveaways, tips – always think back to the WHY. • Start a newsletter. It’s always been the best way to have an engaged small community away from the noise of public social-media platforms. • Quality over quantity in terms of how often you post and number of followers.

        'Back in 2006 a brilliant TED Talk by Eli Pariser called ‘Beware Online “Filter bubbles” ’ was all about how each of our individual Google pages would look different because of what was being catered to us, depending on each of our personal searches. It means that we are not seeing things as organically as we think. Our search engines and feeds are full of ads and paid-for posts and a whole load of behind-the-scenes formulas adapt to what they think we want to see. It’s important that we get out of our filter bubble to get new, exciting work. These filter bubbles hold us back when it comes to networking too, we are in danger of going round and round in circles meeting and connecting with the same people. For this reason it is crucial that we get offline to meet people out of our immediate online circles and broaden our horizons. It’s important that we get out of our small online bubble so that we can attract some work opportunities to add to our multi-hyphenate work streams. Staying in your bubble means that when you do leave a job or want to move, you will have hardly any contacts outside of your office space. The workflow of a multi-hyphenate is dependent on your solid network and on having authentic connections.',

Anna was using her stressful conditions to re-create that rush of energy, and without realizing it, she became emotionally addicted to a life she hated. Science tells us that such chronic, long-term stress pushes the genetic buttons that create disease. So if Anna was turning the stress response on by thinking about her problems and her past, her thoughts were making her sick.

Start breathing in and out from the heart center, and continue to do this more slowly and deeply. When your mind wanders, keep returning your attention and awareness to your chest, your heart, and your breath. Next, while you rest your attention in your fourth center, bring up some elevated emotions while continuing to breathe in and out of your heart center. Once you feel these heartfelt emotions in your chest area, send that energy out beyond your body and marry it with your intention. Continue to broadcast that energy and intention all around you.

In other words, you’re no longer in a creative state because you’ve just returned to the habitual programs and survival emotions of your past. When this occurs, you disconnect from the energy of your future and essentially leave the energy you created right where you were sitting in your meditation, as opposed to carrying it with you throughout the day.

Maybe your twenty are much more interesting than this, but mine include: “I should call my mom.” “Am I any good at my job?” “Why do I still get neck acne?” “Why don’t I either call my mom or not call my mom but stop wasting energy on feeling guilty if I don’t call her?” Et cetera. Now, if I don’t leave town, that’s it. Those are my thoughts. That’s what I’ve got to keep me warm at night. And good Yahweh does that get boring. When you travel you’re forced to have new thoughts. “Is this alley safe?” “Is this the right bus?” “Was this meat ever a house pet?” It doesn’t even matter what the new thoughts are, it feels so good to just have some variety.

In time-space, however, you experience this realm with your awareness—as a consciousness, not as a body with senses. This realm exists beyond your senses. You access this domain when you are totally in the present moment so there is no past or future, just one long now. Since your awareness is beyond the realm of matter, because you have taken all your attention off matter, you can become aware of different frequencies all carrying information, and these frequencies allow you to have access to different unknown dimensions. So if you are in a realm above the senses and unfolding as consciousness into the energy of the unified field, you can experience many possible dimensional realities.

But the truth is, you define the purpose by deciding how you choose to use it. When you learned to ride a bike, I’m sure you were simply shown how to ride the bike, not how you should use that ability. Some use a bike to commute, for others it’s to hang out with friends, and for a very few cycling may even become a career. But the skill of being able to remain in the saddle is the same for each. So while somebody else might have taught you how to ride, you define what cycling means to you, how you use it, and how it best suits your lifestyle. And so it is with the skill of meditation.

It just so happens that when you’re more aware there is very little room for these unpleasant emotions to operate. When you’re thinking about them all the time, then of course you give them lots of room, you keep them active. But if you don’t think about them, then they tend to lose their momentum.”',

        'Mindfulness reduces the intensity of negative emotions Neuroscientists from UCLA recently discovered that people who practice mindfulness techniques experience negative emotions less intensely than those who do not. They found that by “labeling” these emotions and thereby becoming more aware of them, the intensity was significantly reduced. So, the next time you find yourself writing a retaliatory e-mail or wanting to shout at your partner in a fit of rage, label your anger “anger” and you might just avoid having to make an embarrassing apology.',

        'My first year out of college, I started a small test prep company (tutoring for SAT, ACT, etc.). Over the next nine years, I put a large portion of my time into growing that company. Early on, my co-founder and I realized it was an advantage to be two single dudes in our 20s with no real financial obligations, so we decided to keep our lifestyles at the same level even as the company grew. After a good year, instead of giving ourselves a $25,000 raise each, we’d keep our salaries in the same place and hire a $50,000 employee. After a great year, we’d keep our salaries where they were and hire three or four new employees. I can credit my co-founder mostly for this, as he’s the more disciplined one of the two of us, but it turned out to be a good strategy. By the time I turned 30, the company had 20 employees and was generating probably ten times the revenue it would have been generating had we kept upping our salaries each year. We traded the fun of having fancy lifestyles in our 20s for being far more free people at the age of 30. This freedom is what led me to start Wait But Why and become a full-time writer.',

If you don’t have structure, you’re just aimlessly doing stuff.” Rules and routines ease our cognitive burden so we have bandwidth for creativity. Structure enhances spontaneity. And discovery reinvigorates the routine.',

        'Because the soul is eternal, there is no beginning and no end, no time or space. There is only the soul, infinite and beyond our comprehension, yet absolutely present and guiding us back toward nature, toward our true selves. And because there is no beginning or end, there is no death. The soul transcends the body, transcends all matter. In the brief time that we occupy our body, we can seek to reach an understanding of the light within that defines our existence, and that is how we come to access the multitudes, to paraphrase Whitman, contained within us. We don’t have to accept the world the way it is if it doesn’t respect the soul.',

        'A girl in the industrialized world will, on average, begin menstruating at twelve years of age (or earlier in some populations) and continue until menopause, around forty years later. On average, she may get pregnant once or twice, and probably not until her late twenties or early thirties. If she breast-feeds at all, it will probably be for just a few months. Thus, over the course of her lifetime, she’ll go through the ovulation/menstruation cycle from 350 to 400 times. A typical forager female, on the other hand, begins ovulating at sixteen or seventeen, due to her much lower levels of body fat and no exposure to estrogenic contamination from plastics, growth hormones in livestock, and added sugar in her food. She’s likely to become pregnant within a year or so of first ovulation (chastity being extremely uncommon in foraging societies) and will breast-feed each of her children for three to four years. Because lactational amenorrhea normally stops ovulation in breast-feeding women (and almost always in foragers with low body fat), such a woman—living in the physical and social world her body is adapted to—will menstruate only around eighty to one hundred times—about one-quarter as many times as a typical civilized woman. Since each of these menstrual cycles floods a woman’s body with powerful hormones, it’s not surprising that cancer rates in the affected tissues have exploded in modern times.',

Alexander and his colleagues ran a series of experiments centered on identical rats living in two different settings: One group lived in typical laboratory cages while the other group lived in a setting meant to replicate normal rat life as much as possible. The so-called Rat Park was two hundred times bigger than the cages, contained sixteen to twenty rats of both sexes, and plenty of food and toys. What Alexander and his colleagues discovered calls into question every behavioral study ever conducted on caged rats: The rats that were trapped alone in cages opted to get high as much as possible, but the rats with interesting lives (community, space, toys) tried the drugged water once or twice, and then stayed away from it. The rats with lives worth living had little interest in the escapism the drugs offered. Overall, they consumed less than a quarter of the drugged water the isolated rats did. None overdosed or ignored food until they starved.

Great for Nike’s bottom line, but this departure from human biomechanics resulted in tens of thousands of injuries and incalculable costs to human health. McDougall quotes a financial columnist who thought Nike’s plan was “brilliant.” “[They] created a market for a product and then created the product itself. It’s genius, the kind of stuff they study in business schools.” You may think it’s unfair to focus on Nike, but McDougall disagrees. “Blaming the running injury epidemic on big, bad Nike seems too easy,” he writes, “but that’s okay, because it’s largely their fault.”',

Many progressive European societies have policies that replicate hunter-gatherer parenting values by assuring community support for parents via generous maternity and paternity leave, subsidized medical and child care, and free education.',

Unfortunately, the distorted rage resulting from the repression of youth sexual exploration rarely takes the form of rebellion against the people and institutions behind the prohibitions. (If it did, perhaps we’d be reading of abused priests rather than priests as abusers.) Instead, the rage is generally directed at the self (as shame), or at the girls and women who are misperceived as being the cause of the frustration. Entire cultures seem determined to find women to blame for whatever befalls humanity.',

And I don’t let that list get complicated or lengthy. As I teach in Free to Focus, I limit my tasks to what I call my Daily Big 3. So I never have more than three significant tasks to complete in any one day. But those three tasks are chosen specifically to help me achieve my goals.',

Therefore, the samurais of self-regulation actively create conditions of hardship to build their natural power. Truth #3: Like other muscles, willpower weakens when tired. Recovery is, therefore, absolutely necessary for the expression of mastery. And to manage decision fatigue. Truth #4: Installing any great habit successfully follows a distinct four-part pattern for automation of the routine. Follow it explicitly for lasting results. Truth #5: Increasing self-control in one area of your life elevates self-control in all areas of your life.

To quote Kevin, “A true fan is defined as a fan that will buy anything you produce. These diehard fans will drive two hundred miles to see you sing; they will buy the hardback and paperback and Audible versions of your book; they will purchase your next figurine sight unseen; they will pay for the ‘best-of’ DVD version of your free YouTube channel; they will come to your chef’s table once a month.

It’s unlikely that your tree will grow, or even if it does, it’s unlikely to be seen as important, useful, or dominant. It will be crowded out by all the similar trees. As your tree grows, it creates a beacon for the community. The early adopters among the people you seek to serve can engage with the tree, climb it, use it for shade, and, eventually, eat the fruits. And they attract the others. If you have planned well, the tree will quickly grow taller, because the sun isn’t being blocked—there are few other trees in the same area. As the tree grows, it not only attracts other people, but its height (as the dominant choice in the neighborhood) blocks out the futile efforts of other, similar trees. The market likes a winner.

        "The common name for government money is fiat money, from the Latin word for decree, order, or authorization. Two important facts must be understood about government money from the outset. First, there is a very large difference between government money redeemable in gold, and irredeemable government money, even if both are run by the government. Under a gold standard, money is gold, and government just assumes a responsibility of minting standard units of the metal or printing paper backed by the gold. The government has no control over the supply of gold in the economy, and people are able to redeem their paper in physical gold at any time, and use other shapes and forms of gold, such as bullion bars and foreign coins, in their dealings with one another. With irredeemable government money, on the other hand, the government's debt and/or paper is used as money, and the government is able to increase its supply as it sees fit. Should anybody use other forms of money for exchange, or should they attempt to create more of the government's money, they run the risk of punishment.",

        'A few reasons keep government money as the prime money of our time. First, governments mandate that taxes are paid in government money, which means individuals are highly likely to accept it, giving it an edge in its salability. Second, government control and regulation of the banking system means that banks can only open accounts and transact in government‐sanctioned money, thus giving government money a much higher degree of salability than any other potential competitor. Third, legal tender laws make it illegal in many countries to use other forms of money for payment. Fourth, all government moneys are still backed by gold reserves, or backed by currencies backed by gold reserves.',

Harry chooses to only spend his time catching fish with his hands, needing about eight hours a day to catch enough fish to feed himself for the day. Linda, on the other hand, having a lower time preference, spends only six hours catching fish, making do with a smaller amount of fish every day, and spends the other two hours working on building a fishing rod. After a week has passed, Linda has succeeded in building a working fishing rod. In the second week, she can catch in eight hours double the quantity of fish which Harry catches. Linda's investment in the fishing rod could allow her to work for only four hours a day and eat the same amount of fish Harry eats, but because she has a lower time preference, she will not rest on her laurels. She will instead spend four hours catching as many fish as Harry catches in eight hours, and then spend another four hours engaged in further capital accumulation, building herself a fishing boat, for instance. A month later, Linda has a fishing rod and a boat that allows her to go deeper into the sea, to catch fish that Harry had never even seen. Linda's productivity is not just higher per hour; her fish are different from, and superior to, the ones Harry catches. She now only needs one hour of fishing to secure her food for a day, and so she dedicates the rest of her time to even more capital accumulation, building better and bigger fishing rods, nets, and boats, which in turn increases her productivity further and improves the quality of her life.",

        "An important demonstration of the importance of time preference comes from the famous Stanford marshmallow experiment,2 conducted in the late 1960s. Psychologist Walter Mischel would leave children in a room with a piece of marshmallow or a cookie, and tell the kids they were free to have it if they wanted, but that he will come back in 15 minutes, and if the children had not eaten the candy, he would offer them a second piece as a reward. In other words, the children had the choice between the immediate gratification of a piece of candy, or delaying gratification and receiving two pieces of candy. This is a simple way of testing children's time preference: students with a lower time preference were the ones who could wait for the second piece of candy, whereas the students with the higher time preference could not. Mischel followed up with the children decades later and found significant correlation between having a low time preference as measured with the marshmallow test and good academic achievement, high SAT score, low body mass index, and lack of addiction to drugs.",

Indulging immediate pleasures is the more likely course of action economically, and that will then reflect on culture and society at large. The Austrian school, on the other hand, by preaching sound money, recognizes the reality of the trade‐off that nature provides humans, and that if the child waits, there will be more reward for her, making her happier in the long run, encouraging her to defer her gratification to increase it.',

A currency that depreciates in value, on the other hand, leaves citizens constantly searching for returns to beat inflation, returns that must come with a risk, and so leads to an increase in investment in risky projects and an increased risk tolerance among investors, leading to increased losses. Societies with money of stable value generally develop a low time preference, learning to save and think of the future, while societies with high inflation and depreciating economies will develop high time preference as people lose track of the importance of saving and concentrate on immediate enjoyment.',

        "There are three fundamental reasons that drive the relationship between unsound money and war. First, unsound money is itself a barrier to trade between countries, because it distorts value between the countries and makes trade flows a political issue, creating animosity and enmity between governments and populations. Second, government having access to a printing press allows it to continue fighting until it completely destroys the value of its currency, and not just until it runs out of money. With sound money, the government's war effort was limited by the taxes it could collect. With unsound money, it is restrained by how much money it can create before the currency is destroyed, making it able to appropriate wealth far more easily. Third, individuals dealing with sound money develop a lower time preference, allowing them to think more of cooperation rather than conflict, as discussed in Chapter 5.",

It lives because anyone, anywhere, can run a copy of its code. It lives because all the running copies are constantly talking to each other. It lives because if any one copy is corrupted it is discarded, quickly and without any fuss or muss. It lives because it is radically transparent: anyone can see its code and see exactly what it does. It can't be changed. It can't be argued with. It can't be tampered with. It can't be corrupted. It can't be stopped. It can't even be interrupted. If nuclear war destroyed half of our planet, it would continue to live, uncorrupted. It would continue to offer its services. It would continue to pay people to keep it alive. The only way to shut it down is to kill every server that hosts it. Which is hard, because a lot of servers host it, in a lot of countries, and a lot of people want to use it. Realistically, the only way to kill it is to make the service it offers so useless and obsolete that no one wants to use it. So obsolete that no one wants to pay for it. No one wants to host it.

The first halving happened on November 28, 2012, after which the issuance of new bitcoins dropped to 25 per block. On July 9, 2016, it dropped again to 12.5 coins per block, and will drop to 6.25 in 2020.

        "A good example of Bitcoin's antifragility came in the fall of 2013, when the FBI arrested the alleged owner of the Silk Road website, which was a truly free online market allowing users to sell and buy anything they wanted online, including illegal drugs. With Bitcoin's association in the public's mind with drugs and crime, most analysts predicted the closing of the website would destroy Bitcoin's utility. The price on that day dropped from around the $120 range to the $100 range, but it rebounded quickly and began a very fast rise, reaching $1,200 per bitcoin within a few months. At the time of writing, the price had never again dropped to the level it was at before the closing of the Silk Road website. By surviving the closing of the Silk Road unscathed, Bitcoin demonstrated that it is far more than a currency for crime, and in the process it benefited from the free publicity from the Silk Road media coverage.",

A large part of the population pays no rent and no one pays for water, light, public telephones, funerals, or sporting events. Spending on social services increased five times in a few years. But now that everyone has education and shoes, necessities multiply geometrically and production can only grow arithmetically. Cuba has been compelled to escalate its exports, and sugar continues to be its major resource. Many products are in short supply: in 1970, fruit and refrigerators and clothing. Queues, part of the daily routine, are not solely due to disorganized distribution.

Divorce had been largely taboo until the mid-1960s and early 1970s, but once the stigma was gone it was not long before the dissolution of marriage became a common occurrence.

        'With male-oriented women doing more, their female-orientated partners are doing less. This has made too many men lazy, relegating the hard work to women. Women are becoming the initiators of relationships and almost everything related to everyday living. Men are in danger of becoming passengers in life, leaving women to be the engines. We cannot lose sight of the fact that it is the job of masculine energy to initiate and direct. Men seem to have unwittingly relinquished that job to the masculine within women.',

        'On the flip side of the coin, we have male women who are becoming more and more emotionally desolate, with little understanding of why that is. They have become comfortable operating out of their male aspect and are self-sufficient to the extent that they do not have to rely on anyone for anything. Yet in order to feel fulfilled a woman has to be receptive, a fundamental feminine aspect that many women can no longer find in themselves. Unable to receive, they ache for something they can’t identify. These male women assume it is a romantic connection they are missing, so they find a man they can control and dominate. Since opposite energies attract, they attract feminine men.',

Archeological evidence has been found for the concept of yin and yang going back at least five thousand years, and references continue from that point to the present day. Yin-yang theory is based on the premise that all life emerges from a point of perfect balance. Yin and yang are dynamic forces constantly interacting with each other, distinct and individual, but also inseparable.

Later that same day you might feel the urge to sit quietly and have a cup of tea, tapping into your feminine essence as you contemplate what you need to do next, or run through your mind your actions for the next day. Contemplation is generated by your feminine aspect. During this contemplative time you might make some big decisions about how you want to change your life (you’re still thinking it through, which means you are still using your feminine aspect). So you take the steps necessary to carry out those decisions, perhaps by calling a friend about a new job that has opened up in their company.

When the nuclei split, their neutrons could fly away at great speed, smashing into other nearby atoms, causing their nuclei to split in turn, releasing even more energy. If enough uranium atoms were gathered in the correct configuration—forming a critical mass—this process could begin sustaining itself, with one atom’s neutrons splitting the nucleus of another, sending more neutrons into a collision course with further nuclei. As it went critical, the resulting chain reaction of splitting atoms—nuclear fission—would liberate unimaginable quantities of energy.',

Daghlian Jr., a twenty-four-year-old physicist on the Manhattan Project, was conducting an after-hours experiment in Los Alamos, New Mexico, when his hand slipped. The test assembly he had built—a ball of plutonium surrounded by tungsten carbide bricks—went critical. Daghlian saw a momentary blue flash and was struck by a wave of gamma and neutron radiation amounting to more than 500 rem. He quickly disassembled the experiment, walked away, and admitted himself to medical care without visible symptoms. But radiation had killed him as surely as if he’d stepped in front of an oncoming train. Twenty-five days later, Daghlian slipped into a coma from which he never awoke—the first person in history to die accidentally from close exposure to nuclear fission.

The government in Kiev was still plotting the future of the forbidden zone when, on March 11, 2011, the news came in from the Tokyo Electric Power Company’s nuclear plant in Fukushima, Japan. The disaster involving the three General Electric–built reactors on the northeastern coast of Honshu followed a now familiar course, this time played out live on television: a loss of coolant led to reactor meltdown, a dangerous buildup of hydrogen gas, and several catastrophic explosions. No one was killed or injured by the immediate release of radiation, but three hundred thousand people were evacuated from the surrounding area, which will remain contaminated for decades to come. During the early stages of the emergency cleanup, it became clear that robots were incapable of operating in the highly radioactive environment inside the containment buildings of the plant. Japanese soldiers were sent in to do the work, in another Pyrrhic victory of bio-robots over technology.',

The liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR), an even more advanced concept developed at Tennessee’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is fueled by thorium. More plentiful and far harder to process into bomb-making material than uranium, thorium also burns more efficiently in a reactor and could produce less hazardous radioactive waste with half-lives of hundreds, not tens of thousands, of years. Running at atmospheric pressure, and without ever reaching a criticality, the LFTR doesn’t require a massive containment building to guard against loss-of-coolant accidents or explosions and can be constructed on such a compact scale that every steel mill or small town could have its own microreactor tucked away underground.',

Mr Nabuk had to believe – he must have had faith – in the willingness and capacity of the controllers of the granary to give him the grain he was owed once it was produced. And others must have believed that too before accepting Mr Nabuk’s shell-IOUs in exchange for oil or salt or in order to help him build his hut. This is the origin of the word ‘credit’: it comes from the Latin credere, which means ‘to believe’.',

        'Time to revisit the tough question I started off with. Why did the British invade Australia instead of the Aborigines invading England? More generally, why did all imperialist superpowers emerge in Eurasia and not one from Africa or Australia? Does it have to do with DNA? Certainly not. The answer lies in what I have just been telling you. We saw how in the beginning … was surplus. And from agricultural surplus there emerged writing, debt, money and states – and from these economies emerged technologies and armies. Simply put, the geographical conditions in Eurasia – the nature of the land and the climate – meant that agriculture and surplus and all that went with it took hold with great force, leading to the emergence of rulers of states in command of armies equipped with technologies such as guns and made even more lethal by the biochemical weapons they carried in their bodies and on their breath.',

        '‘Why did not a single African country grow powerful enough to threaten Europe? Why was the slave trade such a one-way street? Maybe the Africans weren’t as capable as the Europeans after all?’ Nothing of the sort. Take a look at a map and compare Africa’s shape to Eurasia’s. The first thing you’ll notice is that Africa extends more to the north and south than it does to the east and west, starting off at the Mediterranean, extending south to the equator and then continuing until it reaches the temperate climates of the southern hemisphere. Now take a glance at Eurasia. It does just the opposite, beginning on the Atlantic and spreading east all the way to the Chinese and Vietnamese coasts on the Pacific Ocean. What does this mean? It means that if you crossed Eurasia from the Pacific to the Atlantic you’d encounter relatively few changes in climate, whereas in Africa, as you travel from Johannesburg in the south to Alexandria in the north, you would pass through all kinds of climatic zones – some, such as the tropical jungle or the Sahara Desert, very extreme. And why does this matter? Simply because African societies that developed agricultural economies (current-day Zimbabwe, for example) found it much harder to expand, since their crops didn’t travel well, refusing to take root further north, by the equator – or even worse, in the Sahara. On the other hand, once the peoples of Eurasia discovered agricultural production, they expanded west or east almost at will. Their crops (wheat in particular) could be planted further and further afield, forming a single fairly homogenous farming realm from Lisbon to Shanghai. It was the perfect terrain on which to mount invasions – with one farming people hijacking another’s surpluses and adopting their technologies – and to fashion entire empires.',

They criticize it as a ‘brake on development’, a ‘parasite’ feeding off the private sector through taxation, as an ‘enemy of freedom and entrepreneurship’. The cleverer among them even go so far as to deny that government has any moral right, or duty, to serve society, by claiming that ‘there is no such thing as society – there are just individuals and families’, or ‘society is not well defined enough for the state to be able to serve it’. And yet, when a crash occurs brought on by their actions, those who have delivered the fieriest of speeches vehemently opposing substantial government intervention in the economy suddenly demand the state’s aid. ‘Where is the government when we need it?’ they yelp.',

This has the effect of reducing demand. According to Marx, these three forces eventually lead prices to drop below the level necessary to cover costs and keep the whole thing going.

        'The most minor triggers can produce emotional responses that feel as though they are beyond our control. For instance, you’re driving to work and you stop at your usual coffee shop, which is all out of your favorite, hazelnut coffee. Disappointed, you grumble to yourself why a major enterprise like this one can’t keep in stock such a very popular flavor. At work, you’re irritated to see another car in your preferred parking spot. Stepping into an empty elevator, you are exasperated to discover that someone ahead of you pushed all the buttons. When you finally walk into the office, someone comments, “What’s up? You seem kind of down.” You tell your story, and the person sympathizes. You sum it up: “I’m in a bad mood. I’ll get over it.” The thing is, you don’t. A mood is a chemical state of being, generally short-term, that is an expression of a prolonged emotional reaction. Something in your environment—in this case, the failure of your barista to meet your needs, followed by a few other minor annoyances—sets off an emotional response. The chemicals of that emotion don’t get used up instantly, so their effect lingers for a while. I call that the refractory period—the time after their initial release and until the effect diminishes.2 The longer the refractory period, obviously, the longer you experience those feelings. When the chemical refractory period of an emotional reaction lasts for hours to days, that’s a mood.',

Episodic memories tend to imprint longer in the brain and body than semantic memories. — The second memory system is called nondeclarative or implicit memories. When we practice something so many times that it’s become second nature—we no longer have to think about it; it’s like we almost can’t declare how we do it—the body and mind are one. This is the seat of our skills, habits, automatic behaviors, associative memories, unconscious attitudes, and emotional reactions.',

When the successes pile up, it’s easy to spend time responding to invitations and calls and well-wishers’ requests. Suddenly, the day has cruised by and you haven’t done anything. You feel successful, but nothing is really happening except new meetings. Slowing down means taking the time to care about your schedule—doing what you’ve learned in this book about reviewing your calendar and to-dos each night, each morning, each week. It also means saying no to the good things that would stretch your day too far. If a good opportunity comes up but it’s going to rob you of a few nights’ sleep, force you to cancel strategic moves you planned long ago, or knock you out of time with your family, then just say no. Cramming your day so full that you have no time for thought or rejuvenation just makes you tired and irritable. And no one credits fatigue and a bad mood for their world-class performance.',

Raise the necessity of your level of performance. This means actively tapping into the reasons you must perform well, based on a mix of your internal standards (e.g., your identity, beliefs, values, or expectations for excellence) and external demands (e.g., social obligations, competition, public commitments). Increase productivity in your primary field of interest. Specifically, you’ll need to focus on “prolific quality output” (PQO) in the area in which you want to be known and to drive impact. You’ll also have to minimize distractions (or opportunities) that steal your attention from creating PQO. Develop influence with those around you so you can get them to believe in and support your efforts and ambitions. Without a positive support network, major achievements over the long haul are all but impossible.

This became known as the Central Governor Theory and this is why Noakes believes that the point when you think you cannot go on is actually a response from the brain to slow down to preserve health, rather than a physiological reality. Basically, the brain quits before the body. But why does this happen? Well, for good reason. If your brain didn’t regulate physical exertion in this way you could quite literally run yourself to death, by either destroying skeletal or cardiac muscle or by starving the nerve tissue of sugar and oxygen.',

Cash is also king during times of deflation. The more prices drop, the more your cash can buy. But when prices rise (inflation), its value steadily erodes.

For example, the honest answer to “What state was your brother-in-law born in?” can then be sold by the site you gave that answer to and perhaps combined with other information or used to fill in missing information. For example, from the brother-in-law answer one can infer that you are or were married and that your partner, or your ex, has a sibling who is either a man or married to a man born in the state you provided. That’s a lot of additional information from a simple answer.

Do the opposite of contracting and closing. Relax and release. Relax your heart until you are actually face-to-face with the exact place where it hurts. Stay open and receptive so you can be present right where the tension is. You must be willing to be present right at the place of the tightness and pain, and then relax and go even deeper. This is very deep growth and transformation. But you will not want to do this. You will feel tremendous resistance to doing this, and that’s what makes it so powerful. As you relax and feel the resistance, the heart will want to pull away, to close, to protect, and to defend itself. Keep relaxing. Relax your shoulders and relax your heart. Let go and give room for the pain to pass through you. It’s just energy. Just see it as energy and let it go.',

It is this information, within the file, that the US military used to find the Daesh headquarters in the desert, just as Mark Loveless used EXIF data to identify John McAfee’s location. Anyone can use this tool—it’s native in the file inspector on Apple OSX and in downloadable tools such as FOCA for Windows and Metagoofil for Linux—to gain access to the metadata stored in photos and documents.',

We say thank you, Granny!’; ‘And say goodbye to Auntie Jane’; ‘No, say goodbye NICELY!’; ‘And say bye-bye to Pickles’; ‘We’re leaving now, so say goodbye again’; ‘Come on now, wave, wave bye-bye!’[28] The English often refer to this ritual not as ‘saying goodbye’ but as ‘saying our goodbyes’, as in ‘I can’t come to the station, so we’ll say our goodbyes here.’ I discussed this with an American visitor, who said, ‘You know, the first time I heard that expression, I didn’t really register the plural – or I guess I thought it meant you said one each or something. Now I know it means a LOT of goodbyes.’',

        'To take a deliberately extreme example, the kind of hand-on-heart, gushing earnestness and pompous, Bible-thumping solemnity favoured by almost all American politicians[30] would never win a single vote in this country. We watch these speeches on our news programmes with a kind of smugly detached amusement, wondering how the cheering crowds can possibly be so credulous as to fall for this sort of nonsense. When we are not feeling smugly amused, we are cringing with vicarious embarrassment: how can these politicians bring themselves to utter such shamefully earnest platitudes, in such ludicrously solemn tones? We expect politicians to speak largely in platitudes, of course – ours are no different in this respect; it is the earnestness that makes us wince.',

        'the opening ceremony for the London Olympics in 2012 seemed to me another particularly good example of English humour, self-mockery and aversion to earnestness. Although the spectacular parts of the ceremony were suitably grand and impressive, there was very little of the overblown self-important pomposity that normally characterises such ceremonies. Instead, almost every element included at least one ironic little twist, at least one humorous reminder that we don’t take ourselves too seriously. A performance of the famously stirring and emotive Chariots of Fire music by the London Symphony Orchestra, for example, was subverted throughout by the antics of comedian Rowan Atkinson, acting the part of a bored and distracted musician. We couldn’t even be serious about the arrival of our Queen to open the Games: this was done as a spoof of a James Bond film, with Her Majesty sportingly playing herself. If ever there were an excuse for patriotic pomp and grandeur, it must surely be hosting the Olympic Games – and yet we took this opportunity to poke fun at ourselves and our most cherished institutions.',

The boastful, sentimental, flag-waving patriotism of other nations is frowned upon and makes us cringe. We may feel proud to be English, but we are mostly too squeamish and too cynical – too conscious of the unwritten ban on earnestness – to make a big, gushy, patriotic fuss about it.

Royal events are brief episodes of what anthropologists call ‘cultural remission’ or ‘festive inversion’ – like carnivals or tribal festivals, where some of the usual social norms and unwritten rules are temporarily suspended and the English do things we would never normally do: waving national flags, cheering and dancing in the streets, and even talking to strangers. We welcome any opportunity to have a day off work, break the rules and indulge in disinhibited behaviour of this kind, and a royal wedding or jubilee is as good an excuse as any for a bit of ‘legitimised deviance’.',

Rather than risk exhibiting any hint of forbidden solemnity, unseemly emotion or excessive zeal, we go to the opposite extreme and feign dry, deadpan indifference. The understatement rule means that a debilitating and painful chronic illness must be described as ‘a bit of a nuisance’; a truly horrific experience is ‘well, not exactly what I would have chosen’; a sight of breathtaking beauty is ‘quite pretty’; an outstanding performance or achievement is ‘not bad’; an act of abominable cruelty is ‘not very friendly’, and an unforgivably stupid misjudgement is ‘not very clever’; the Antarctic is ‘rather chilly’ and the Sahara ‘a bit too warm for my taste’; and any exceptionally delightful object, person or event, which in other cultures would warrant streams of superlatives, is pretty much covered by ‘nice’, or, if we wish to express more ardent approval, ‘very nice’.',

        'All this talk of moaning may be making the English sound rather sad and depressing, but that is not the case. The curious thing about all of these moan sessions is that the tone is actually quite cheerful, good-natured and, above all, humorous. In fact, this is probably one of the most important ‘rules of moaning’: you must moan in a relatively good-humoured, light-hearted manner. However genuinely grumpy you may be feeling, this must be disguised as mock-grumpiness.',

        'Along with ‘nice’, ‘typical’ is one of the most useful and versatile words in the English vocabulary – a generic, all-purpose term of disapproval, it can be applied to any problem, annoyance, mishap or disaster, from the most insignificant irritation to adverse events of national or even international importance. On the morning of the 7/7 bombings in London, when news of the horrifying terrorist attacks on the Underground reached the tube station where I was waiting for a train, the passengers around me incorporated this inconvenience into their standard ritual moans, with grumbles such as, ‘Of course bloody Al Qaeda had to pick the one day I really needed to get to work on time! Typical!’ There is something quintessentially English about ‘Typical!’ It manages simultaneously to convey huffy indignation and a sense of passive, resigned acceptance, an acknowledgement that things will invariably go wrong, that life is full of little frustrations and difficulties (and highly inconsiderate terrorists), and that one must simply put up with it. In a way, ‘Typical!’ is a manifestation of what used to be called the English ‘stiff upper lip’: it is a complaint, but a complaint that also expresses a very English kind of grudging forbearance and restraint – a sort of grumpy, cynical stoicism.',

Watching soaps such as EastEnders and Coronation Street is like being allowed to peer through a spyhole into the hidden, forbidden, private lives of our neighbours, our social peers – people like us, but about whom we can normally only guess and speculate.

Some psychologists use the terms ‘limbic resonance’, ‘emotional contagion’ or ‘mood contagion’ to describe this effect. To put it very simply, when others around us are clapping, dancing, laughing and cheering, the mirror neurons in our brains are activated and mimic these actions, and there is a link between these neurons and the limbic system, so our emotions are activated as well: we feel happy and connected.',

Medieval football matches were essentially pitched battles between the young men of rival villages and towns. They involved hundreds of ‘players’, and were often used as opportunities to settle old feuds, personal arguments and land disputes. Some forms of ‘folk-football’ existed in other countries (such as the German Knappen and the Florentine calcio in costume), but the roots of modern football are in these violent English rituals.',

Make sure you have good tests before you begin refactoring. Run the tests as often as possible. That way you will know quickly if your changes have broken anything. Take short, deliberate steps: move a field from one class to another, split a method, rename a variable. Refactoring often involves making many localized changes that result in a larger-scale change. If you keep your steps small, and test after each step, you will avoid prolonged debugging.[57]',

        'The long, lavish, boozy ‘business lunch’ is nowadays somewhat frowned upon (more of that American-inspired puritanical health-correctness), which is a great shame, as it was based on very sound anthropological and psychological principles. The giving and sharing of food is universally known to be one of the most effective forms of human social bonding. Anthropologists even have a special jargon-word for it: ‘commensality’. In all cultures, the offering and acceptance of such hospitality constitutes at the very least a non-aggression pact between the parties – you do not ‘break bread’ with your enemies – and at best a significant move towards cementing friendships and alliances. And it is even more effective if the social lubricant of alcohol is involved.',

        'Perhaps most importantly, tea-making is the perfect displacement activity: whenever the English feel awkward or uncomfortable in a social situation (that is, almost all of the time), they make tea. It’s a universal rule: when in doubt, put the kettle on. Visitors arrive; we have our usual difficulties over greeting protocol. We say, ‘I’ll just put the kettle on.’ There is one of those uneasy lulls in the conversation, and we’ve run out of weather-speak. We say, ‘Now, who’d like more tea? I’ll just go and put the kettle on.’ A business meeting might involve having to talk about money. We postpone the uncomfortable bit by making sure everyone has tea. A bad accident – people are injured and in shock: tea is needed. ‘I’ll put the kettle on.’ War breaks out – a nuclear attack is imminent. ‘I’ll put the kettle on.’[108]',

Turn on the faucet. Wash yourself with the emotion. It won’t hurt you. It will only help. If you let the fear inside, if you pull it on like a familiar shirt, then you can say to yourself, “All right, it’s just fear, I don’t have to let it control me. I see it for what it is.” Same for loneliness: you let go, let the tears flow, feel it completely—but eventually be able to say, “All right, that was my moment with loneliness. I’m not afraid of feeling lonely, but now I’m going to put that loneliness aside and know that there are other emotions in the world, and I’m going to experience them as well.” “Detach,” Morrie said again.',

Others (usually morning larks) will chastise night owls on the erroneous assumption that such preferences are a choice, and if they were not so slovenly, they could easily wake up early.

As a social species, should we not all be synchronized and therefore awake at the same time to promote maximal human interactions? Perhaps not. As we’ll discover later in this book, humans likely evolved to co-sleep as families or even whole tribes, not alone or as couples. Appreciating this evolutionary context, the benefits of such genetically programmed variation in sleep/wake timing preferences can be understood. The night owls in the group would not be going to sleep until one or two a.m., and not waking until nine or ten a.m. The morning larks, on the other hand, would have retired for the night at nine p.m. and woken at five a.m. Consequently, the group as a whole is only collectively vulnerable (i.e., every person asleep) for just four rather than eight hours, despite everyone still getting the chance for eight hours of sleep. That’s potentially a 50 percent increase in survival fitness. Mother Nature would never pass on a biological trait—here, the useful variability in when individuals within a collective tribe go to sleep and wake up—that could enhance the survival safety and thus fitness of a species by this amount.

Both you and the meeting attendees are falling prey to an evolutionarily imprinted lull in wakefulness that favors an afternoon nap, called the post-prandial alertness dip (from the Latin prandium, “meal”). This brief descent from high-degree wakefulness to low-level alertness reflects an innate drive to be asleep and napping in the afternoon, and not working.

I will be practicing a particular piece, even late into the evening, and I cannot seem to master it. Often, I make the same mistake at the same place in a particular movement. I go to bed frustrated.

As we learned about earlier, when you do not get enough sleep, and the body’s stress-related, fight-or-flight nervous system is revved up, this triggers an excess of circulating cortisol that cultivates “bad bacteria” to fester throughout your microbiome.

The dream took hold of the swirling ingredients in his mind and, in a moment of creative brilliance, snapped them together in a divine grid, with each row (period) and each column (group) having a logical progression of atomic and orbiting electron characteristics, respectively. In Mendeleev’s own words:II I saw in a dream a table where all the elements fell into place as required. Awakening, I immediately wrote it down on a piece of paper. Only in one place did a correction later seem necessary.',

        'Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones has arguably the best sleep-inspired story, which gave rise to the opening riff of their song “Satisfaction.” Richards would routinely keep a guitar and tape recorder at his bedside to record ideas that would come to him in the night. He describes the following experience on May 7, 1965, after having returned to his hotel room in Clearwater, Florida, following a performance that evening: I go to bed as usual with my guitar, and I wake up the next morning, and I see that the tape is run to the very end. And I think, “Well, I didn’t do anything. Maybe I hit a button when I was asleep.” So I put it back to the beginning and pushed play and there, in some sort of ghostly version, is [the opening lines to “Satisfaction”]. It was a whole verse of it. And after that, there’s 40 minutes of me snoring. But there’s the song in its embryo, and I actually dreamt the damned thing.',

Then I teach you another relationship, which is that object B should be chosen over object C (B>C). Two separate, isolated premises. If I then show you A and C together, and ask you which you would choose, you would very likely pick A over C because your brain made an inferential leap. You took two preexisting memories (A>B and B>C) and, by flexibly interrelating them (A>B>C), came up with a completely novel answer to a previously unasked question (A>C).

Then he would take a metal saucepan and turn it upside down, carefully positioning it on the floor directly below the right-side armrest of the chair. If that were not strange enough, he would pick up two or three steel ball bearings in his right hand. Finally, Edison would settle himself down into the chair, right hand supported by the armrest, grasping the ball bearings. Only then would Edison ease back and allow sleep to consume him whole. At the moment he began to dream, his muscle tone would relax and he would release the ball bearings, which would crash on the metal saucepan below, waking him up. He would then write down all of the creative ideas that were flooding his dreaming mind. Genius, wouldn’t you agree?',

Instead, the hot bath invites blood to the surface of your skin, giving you that flushed appearance. When you get out of the bath, those dilated blood vessels on the surface quickly help radiate out inner heat, and your core body temperature plummets. Consequently, you fall asleep more quickly because your core is colder. Hot baths prior to bed can also induce 10 to 15 percent more deep NREM sleep in healthy adults.IV',

Habits cannot form outside the Habit Zone, where the behavior occurs with enough frequency and perceived utility.

Unlike Mahalo, Quora did not offer a single cent to anyone answering user questions. Why, then, have users remained highly engaged with Quora but not with Mahalo, despite its variable monetary rewards? In Mahalo’s case, executives assumed that paying users would drive repeat engagement with the site. After all, people like money, right? Unfortunately, Mahalo had an incomplete understanding of its users’ drivers. Ultimately, the company found that people did not want to use a Q&A site to make money. If the trigger was a desire for monetary rewards, users were better off spending their time earning an hourly wage. And if the payouts were meant to take the form of a game, like a slot machine, then the rewards came far too infrequently and were too small to matter. However, Quora demonstrated that social rewards and the variable reinforcement of recognition from peers proved to be much more frequent and salient motivators. Quora instituted an upvoting system that reports user satisfaction with answers and provides a steady stream of social feedback. Quora’s social rewards have proven more attractive than Mahalo’s monetary rewards.',

For example, during an episode in the first season, Walter White must find a way to dispose of the bodies of two rival drug dealers. Challenges prevent resolution of the conflict and suspense is created as the audience waits to find out how the story line ends. In this particular episode White discovers one of the drug dealers is still alive and is faced with the dilemma of having to kill someone he thought was already dead. Invariably, each episode’s central conflict is resolved near the end of the show, at which time a new challenge arises to pique the viewer’s curiosity.

        'CURSE THEORY: In 1577, after noticing that Inuit people in northeastern (freezing-cold) Canada were darker than the people living in the hotter south, English travel writer George Best determined—conveniently for all parties interested in owning slaves—that it couldn’t have been climate that made darker people inferior, and instead determined that Africans were, in fact, cursed. (First of all, could you imagine someone on the Travel Channel telling you that you’re cursed? Like… really?) And what did Best use to prove this theory? Only one of the most irrefutable books of the time: the Bible. In Best’s whimsical interpretation of the book of Genesis, Noah orders his White sons not to have sex with their wives on the ark, and then tells them that the first child born after the flood would inherit the earth. When the evil, tyrannical, and hypersexual Ham (goes HAM and) has sex on the ark, God wills that Ham’s descendants will be dark and disgusting, and the whole world will look at them as symbols of trouble. Simply put, Ham’s kids would be Black and bad, ultimately making Black… bad. Curse theory would become the anchor of what would justify American slavery.',

You didn’t think; you labored, without interruption, and your work was visible and tangible. Today, that’s flipped. Thirty-eight percent of jobs are now designated as “managers, officials, and professionals.” These are decision-making jobs. Another 41% are service jobs that often rely on your thoughts as much as your actions. More of us have jobs that look closer to Rockefeller than a typical 1950s manufacturing worker, which means our days don’t end when we clock out and leave the factory.

        'Become OK with a lot of things going wrong. You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune, because a small minority of things account for the majority of outcomes. No matter what you’re doing with your money you should be comfortable with a lot of stuff not working. That’s just how the world is. So you should always measure how you’ve done by looking at your full portfolio, rather than individual investments. It is fine to have a large chunk of poor investments and a few outstanding ones. That’s usually the best-case scenario. Judging how you’ve done by focusing on individual investments makes winners look more brilliant than they were, and losers appear more regrettable than they should.',

Peter, a bank branch manager making $80,000 a year, sees Joe and feels a subconscious sense of entitlement to live a similar lifestyle, because Peter’s parents believed—and instilled in him—that Americans’ lifestyles weren’t that different even if they had different jobs. His parents were right during their era, because incomes fell into a tight distribution. But that was then. Peter lives in a different world.

        'My first eye-opening exposure to the topic was through a white paper that was published by Google in 2009. The paper discussed how Google deployed a bit of its abundant computer power to run an experiment in which the machine was asked to ‘watch’ YouTube videos frame by frame and try to observe recurring patterns. The machine was completely unprompted, meaning it was not told which patterns to look for – just to observe and see if patterns could be found. It did not take long before a familiar pattern was detected, one that tends to occur very frequently on YouTube. A small, furry, fuzzy, moving object. It was a cat! The computers did not just recognize the side view or the front view or the face of a cat. They observed the whole pattern of entitled cuteness and applied it to every shape in a YouTube video that could resemble a cat. Once that pattern was labelled as a cat, the machine could easily find every single one of those felines across the hundreds of millions of videos on YouTube. It wasn’t too long afterwards that the machine could find letters, words, humans, nudity, cars and most of the other recurring entities that exist online. These neural networks, as we call them, built through Deep Learning, truly were the beginning of AI as we know it today.',

Apparently, evidence from hundreds of witnesses revealed that these serial murders were particularly sadistic and when she was eventually arrested, horribly mutilated girls were found imprisoned and dying on her vast estate. There were even rumours that to try and stay young she bathed in virgins’ blood, thus inspiring the vampire fantasies of Bram Stoker’s Dracula. But how can it be possible for a woman who seemingly has such material advantages to turn out so depraved?',

But a goldfish does feel panic, perhaps a bit too often, and reacts by quickly swimming away when a threat presents itself.

Have you seen those types of swimming pools? Then there was a big drought; for a couple years, it was forbidden to fill your swimming pool because there wasn’t enough water. Guess what happened next? Skateboarding exploded in popularity across California. Skateboarders saw those curves and thought, 'If I stand on the edge and kick down, we could have some fun with this!' All of the swimming pools which had been designed with curves, became the first skate parks. Skateboarding wasn’t a big deal before then and mostly involved riding in straight, flat lines.

When we have this explosion of interest in cryptocurrencies, many of us find ourselves talking to people who seem to be speaking a different language. They are very interested in the price and which shitcoin will be the \'next big thing.\' They are very interested in understanding how they can \'fake it until they make it\' to be successful. When I am asked to talk to companies about cryptocurrencies and blockchains, and they tell me about their "wonderful new project," I ask them, "What is success to you? Let’s say that you succeed. What does your company achieve? Describe success to me." Inevitably, they fail to answer that question. In many cases, they haven’t actually thought about what success will look like, other than, "We will make loads of money!" This is a very important question to ask: what does success look like to you? "We will build the best product that dominates the market and make us lots of money!" Who does that help? "Me." Okay, great. But that is not enough people. Can we think about how we can help more people? Your current business plan is about helping four people. Can we increase the scale a bit? Can we think about helping more people?

If we were at someone’s house and his servant broke a cup, we would be unlikely to get angry; indeed, we might try to calm our host by saying “It’s just a cup; these things happen.” Engaging in projective visualization, Epictetus believes, will make us appreciate the relative insignificance of the bad things that happen to us and will therefore prevent them from disrupting our tranquility.',

If you just look at something, it appears straightforward enough, and the array of wonderful features seems to be a virtue. You may not realize that you won’t be able to figure out how to use those features. I urge you to test products before you buy them.

If you ask a Protestant from the American Midwest to commit to a dinner date next week, that Protestant, believing that she is the captain of her own destiny, will say, “Thursday night works fine for me.” But if you ask a Catholic from Calabria to make the same commitment, he will only shrug, turn his eyes to God, and ask, “How can any of us know whether we will be free for dinner next Thursday night, given that everything is in God’s hands and none of us can know our fate?”',

        'Historically, computers were built to be highly reliable. This meant software running on those computers usually didn’t handle failure gracefully; the computers they ran on rarely failed. EC2 changed all that. From the start, Amazon made it clear computers rented in EC2 could fail at any time. Your software had to deal with failure or else. The reason is the kind of computers used in EC2. Those highly reliable computers are expensive. EC2 has hundreds of thousands of computers. There’s no way they could afford to buy that many expensive, highly reliable computers. Instead, Amazon buys cheaper off-the-shelf computers. Since the computers are cheap, Amazon buy lots of them, and since they’re cheap, there’s a higher chance they can fail. Imagine your phone dropping in the middle of a phone call. That’s what can happen to a computer in EC2 at any time. It’s important to understand that computers failing is not considered the exception. Computers failing in the cloud is the norm, it’s expected, it’s OK, and that changes how software is developed. Your software must expect failure. If a computer fails, you should rent another one and restart your software on the new computer. The computer that failed is dead to you. It’s gone. Don’t worry about.

As he himself said, “There might come a time when one will not remember my name; one might even have forgotten that our school ever existed.” Then he went on to say that it didn’t matter. The implication being that if his school were forgotten, it would be because his ideas had outgrown the bounds of a single area of scholarship, and become commonplace, and a feeling shared by everyone. For example, Dale Carnegie, who wrote the international bestsellers How to Win Friends and Influence People and How to Stop Worrying and Start Living, referred to Adler as “a great psychologist who devoted his life to researching humans and their latent abilities.” The influence of Adler’s thinking is clearly present throughout his writings. And in Stephen Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, much of the content closely resembles Adler’s ideas. In other words, rather than being a strict area of scholarship, Adlerian psychology is accepted as a realization, a culmination of truths and of human understanding. Yet Adler’s ideas are said to have been a hundred years ahead of their time, and even today we have not managed to fully comprehend them.',

It doesn’t lead to happiness. It often leads to self-absorption and discontent. Second, discomfort is a catalyst for growth. It makes us yearn for something more. It forces us to change, stretch, and adapt. Third, discomfort signals progress. When you push yourself to grow, you will experience discomfort, but there’s profit in the pain.',

Don't just say: “I am broke.” It is more correct to say: “I previously had thoughts, actions, and states of being that led to this manifestation of being broke that I am now observing.” In fact, never say, think, or feel negative thoughts. “I am” statements are always carried out by the universe.",

Asking her to do things for me instead of brushing aside any offer of help, as I did for years out of anger. Letting her handle all the money I won. Returning her hugs instead of tolerating them. My time in the arena made me realize how I needed to stop punishing her for something she couldn't help, specifically the crushing depression she fell into after my father's death. Because sometimes things happen to people and they're not equipped to deal with them.",

During this thirty-day break, explore and rediscover activities and behaviors that you find satisfying and meaningful. At the end of the break, reintroduce optional technologies into your life, starting from a blank slate. For each technology you reintroduce, determine what value it serves in your life and how specifically you will use it so as to maximize this value.',
